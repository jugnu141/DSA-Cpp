## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each folder represents a topic and contains `.cpp` files of related problems.
## 📄 File Format

Each `.cpp` file includes:
- ✅ Problem title and platform link (as a comment)
- ✅ Brief explanation or approach
- ✅ Time and space complexity
- ✅ Clean, well-structured C++ code

Example:
```cpp
// Problem: Two Sum
// Platform: LeetCode
// Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
// Approach: HashMap
// Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
